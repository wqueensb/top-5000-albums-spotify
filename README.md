# Top-5000-Albums-Spotify
I found another interesting dataset on Kaggle and this one appealed to my love of music. Using SQL I was able to perform ETL functions and find interesting facts from this dataset. 

 [Top 100 Artists by Danceability](top_100_artists_by_danceabilty_on_spotify)

Danceability-the ability to make you get up and dance without a care in the world. This criteria is very important when it comes to determining an artist's
commercial success. I created a query to examine this dataset to find out the 100 artists who lead in this category. 

[Top 10 Albums on Spotify](https://github.com/wqueensb/top-5000-albums-spotify/blob/1d1a05cb07f7fd649b6ec42e5a73be40616e6a39/top_ten_albums_by_avg_rating)


When examining this list I looked at the average rating issued by Spotify's users and choose the top ten albums for this list. This table is arranged by artist name, album and average rating.
